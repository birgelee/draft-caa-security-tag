          CAA Security Tag for Cryptographic Domain Validation
                draft-birgelee-lamps-caa-security-latest

Abstract

   CAA "security" tags are a type of CAA record (defined in RFC 6844)
   with the critical flag set that specify that for a certificate to be
   issued, the issuance process must be conducted in a manner that has
   cryptographic guarantees and does not rely on plain-text network
   connections.  Cryptographic issuance procedures are authenticated and
   resilient against attacks by both on and off path network attackers
   which may be between the CA and the domain contained in the
   certificate.  This document defines the syntax of "security" CAA
   records as well as acceptable means for validating domains in a
   cryptographic manner.

1.  Introduction

   A "security" CAA record is compliant with RFC 6844 and puts
   restrictions on the circumstances under which a CA can sign a
   certificate for a given domain.  A “security” CAA record on a domain
   implies that validation for this domain must be done in a manner that
   offers security against network adversaries even if an adversary is
   capable of intercepting and/or modifying domain-control-validation-
   related communication between the CA and the domain being validated.
   Issuance of a certificate to a domain with a "security" CAA tag MUST
   follow one of the specified Cryptographic Domain Validation (CDV)
   methods outlined in this document or future extensions.  CDV methods
   MUST rely on cryptographic protocols (like DNSSEC or DoH/DoT) that
   offer security properties even in the presence of man-in-the-middle
   adversaries that can intercept any communication which occurs over
   the public Internet.

   Not all CDV methods are in themselves compliant with the CA/Browser
   Forum Baseline Requirements for TLS server certificate issuance.  Any
   CDV method that does not additionally meet the CA/Browser Forums
   Baseline Requirements for TLS server certificate issuance must be
   used in conjunction with a method that satisfies the CA/Browser
   Forums Baseline Requirements for TLS server certificate issuance.
   Such methods are indicated in their descriptions.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  CAA "security" Tag Protection

   A "security" CAA tag SHOULD be protected with a valid DNSSEC
   signature chain going back to the ICANN DNSSEC root or hosted on
   authoritative DNS servers that CAs have authenticated communication
   channels with.  Any High-security-validation CAA record not protected
   by such a signature MAY not benefit from the security properties
   outlined in this document.  If it is not possible to have a DNSSEC
   signature chain back to the ICANN root, High-Security-Validation CAA
   records SHOULD alternately be hosted in an authoritative DNS resolver
   that supports recursive-to-authoritative DNS over TLS or DNS over
   HTTPS per RFC 9539.  CAs SHOULD also require recursive-to-
   authoritative DNS over TLS or DNS over HTTPS communication (and not
   permit standard unencrypted DNS connections) for DNS providers that
   host High-Security-Validation CAA records.  This prevents downgrade
   attacks where an adversary attempts to interfere with the
   establishment of a DNS over TLS or DNS over HTTPS encrypted channel
   and cause a fallback to unencrypted DNS over UDP/TCP.

   Serving "security" CAA records over authenticated DNS channels or
   using authenticated DNS records (i.e., DNSSEC) is critical to the
   effectiveness of the records because a "security" CAA record not
   protected by authenticated DNS may be suppressed by an adversary that
   can manipulate DNS responses.  This could potentially allow the
   adversary to downgrade validation to use a non-high-security method
   and undermine the security properties of the "security" tag.

4.  High-Security-Validation CAA Record Syntax

   The flags field of the security tag MUST have the critical bit set.

   A single domain CANNOT have multiple "security" tags specified.  A
   domain's entire cryptographic domain validaton policy MUST be encoded
   into a single "security" tag.  If a CA finds a domain that has
   multiple "security" CAA tags at the same FQDN, the CA MUST block
   issuance.

   The value field of the "security" tag MUST be one of three values

   1.  an empty string.

   2.  entierly whitespace.

   3.  a property_list as defined in this document.

   Values 1. and 2.  MUST be treated identically as an empty value
   field.

   A property_list is defined by the following syntax

   [whitespace]<property>[whitespace][,[whitespace]<property>[whitespace
   ] ...]

   A property_list can be abitrarily long.  Whitespace between
   properties is ignored. properties are comma-separated. property_lists
   cannot be empty (i.e., must have at least one property).

   A property is defined as

   <property_name>[whitespace][(property_list)]

5.  Well-known Properties

   1.  *methods* If specified, this property MUST have parameters
       listing various cryptographic domain validation methods that can
       be used to validate that particular domain.  A CA MUST only use
       one of the methods specified in the parameters value_list to
       perform cryptographic domain validation.  If there is no method
       specified that the CA is capable of complying with, the CA MUST
       deny issuance.

6.  Security Considerations

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
